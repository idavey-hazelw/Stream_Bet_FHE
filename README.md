# FHE-based Game Streaming Platform with Private Betting

Experience the thrill of game streaming and private betting like never before! Our platform empowers viewers to place real-time bets on the next move or the outcome of a match while ensuring that all bets are securely encrypted using **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This innovative approach guarantees privacy for the audience and maintains fairness in the betting market, all while enhancing viewer engagement.

## The Challenge: Privacy and Fairness in Betting

In the realm of live game streaming, traditional betting methods often expose sensitive user data and compromise the integrity of betting systems. Viewers may hesitate to engage due to concerns about privacy, security, and the transparency of betting operations. Without a solid framework for protecting user interactions, platforms risk alienating their audience and losing potential revenue from betting activities.

## Harnessing FHE: The Zama Solution

By employing **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, this project utilizes Fully Homomorphic Encryption to create an environment where viewer bets remain confidential and secure. This means that while the betting process occurs in real-time, sensitive information stays encrypted, allowing the live stream to remain engaging and interactive without sacrificing user privacy. Our architecture not only secures transactions but also dynamically updates odds based on encrypted betting pools, further enhancing the user experience.

## Core Functionalities

- **FHE Encrypted Betting**: All viewer bets are FHE encrypted, ensuring anonymity and security in the betting process.
- **Dynamic Odds**: Odds change dynamically based on encrypted betting pools, allowing for fair and responsive betting.
- **Interactive Experience**: Viewers can engage with streamers in a new way while betting, enhancing the overall viewing experience.
- **Monetization Opportunities**: The platform opens up new revenue streams for streamers and viewers alike, creating a mutually beneficial environment.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**: Used for secure and confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: For building the server-side application.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Used for smart contract development and deployment.
- **React.js**: For the front-end interface, ensuring a responsive user experience.
- **Web3.js**: For interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started: Installation Guide

Before you proceed with the installation, ensure that you have the latest version of **Node.js** installed on your machine. To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the project files** to your local development environment. 
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will fetch all required libraries, including Zama's FHE libraries.

## Build & Run Instructions

Once your installation is complete, you can build and run the project using these commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Deploy the smart contracts to the network:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

3. **Start the client application:**

   ```bash
   npm start --prefix client
   ```

Now, navigate to your browser and you should see the streaming and betting platform live!

## A Sneak Peek: Betting Code Example

Here’s a brief code snippet demonstrating how a user might place a bet in the project using FHE:

```javascript
async function placeBet(betAmount, choice) {
    const encryptedBet = await encryptBet(betAmount, choice); // Encrypting the bet
    const tx = await bettingContract.placeBet(encryptedBet);
    await tx.wait();
    console.log(`Bet of ${betAmount} placed on ${choice} successfully!`);
}
```

In this example, the `encryptBet` function is responsible for handling the encryption before the bet is processed on the blockchain.
